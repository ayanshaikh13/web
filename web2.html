	<p>My favorite Internet site is HowStuffWorks because it combines humor 
	and educational topics. I love to laugh,
	but I want to stay informed on the world and its
	latest social and scientific advancements. 
	It's great to learn and be entertained and this website
	can deliver on both.This is a video that I made for my students 
	several years ago. It contains some up-to-date language about 
	the internet. I made it because most of this sort of language in 
	textbooks is hopelessly out-of-date. However, 
	I recommend that you try to guess the words before you look. 
	This will help you to remember them better. üòâA web page provides 
	information to viewers, including pictures or videos to help

	 <p>BMW is a well-known company with a high status branding that 
	 has a very high recognition factor. The company has been strengths
	 in both research and development and design as well as in marketing.
	 For example when it comes to marketing it was a BMW advertisement 
	 that was the first e-advertisement that made it to Campaigns 
	 'Pick of the Week' (Doman). However, in a long-term purchase such 
	 as these, there is a need for more substance than just marketing, 
	 otherwise the life of the company would be relatively short due to
	 the nature of the purchaseüòè.The BMW Group is the world's leading 
	 provider of premium cars and motorcycles and the home of the BMW,
	 MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands. Our vehicles and products
